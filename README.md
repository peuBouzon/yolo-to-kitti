# yolo-to-kitti
This repo converts yolo labels to kitti format.

## Requirements 
pip install Pillow

## Usage 
With known images height and width:

  ```python yolotokitti.py --labels LABELS_FOLDER --height HEIGHT --width WIDTH```

Getting width and height dynamically from images:

  ```python yolotokitti.py --labels LABELS_FOLDER --images IMAGES_FOLDER```

#### Label format

From the doc of: [https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/v4.0.0-rc.3/digits/extensions/data/objectDetection/README.md](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DIGITS/blob/v4.0.0-rc.3/digits/extensions/data/objectDetection/README.md)

Data Format Description
=======================

The data for training and testing can be found in the corresponding folders.
The sub-folders are structured as follows:

  - image_02/ contains the left color camera images (png)
  - label_02/ contains the left color camera label files (plain text files)
  - calib/ contains the calibration for all four cameras (plain text file)

The 15 columns represent:

#Values    Name      Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1    type         Describes the type of object: 'Car', 'Van', 'Truck',
                     'Pedestrian', 'Person_sitting', 'Cyclist', 'Tram',
                     'Misc' or 'DontCare'
   1    truncated    Float from 0 (non-truncated) to 1 (truncated), where
                     truncated refers to the object leaving image boundaries
   1    occluded     Integer (0,1,2,3) indicating occlusion state:
                     0 = fully visible, 1 = partly occluded
                     2 = largely occluded, 3 = unknown
   1    alpha        Observation angle of object, ranging [-pi..pi]
   4    bbox         2D bounding box of object in the image (0-based index):
                     contains left, top, right, bottom pixel coordinates
   3    dimensions   3D object dimensions: height, width, length (in meters)
   3    location     3D object location x,y,z in camera coordinates (in meters)
   1    rotation_y   Rotation ry around Y-axis in camera coordinates [-pi..pi]
   1    score        Only for results: Float, indicating confidence in
                     detection, needed for p/r curves, higher is better.

Here, 'DontCare' labels denote regions in which objects have not been labeled,
for example because they have been too far away from the laser scanner. To
prevent such objects from being counted as false positives our evaluation
script will ignore objects detected in don't care regions of the test set.
You can use the don't care labels in the training set to avoid that your object
detector is harvesting hard negatives from those areas, in case you consider
non-object regions from the training images as negative examples.
